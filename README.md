# React-Native Project: 

I developed this "BanQu-ReactNative" project by using React-Native.


## Prerequisites

-Node

-Yarn

-Web Browser (Chrome)


## Running

1. Download project from github https://github.com/ithunter101/BanQu-ReactNative
2. Run command "npm install" to download packages
3. Run command "yarn web" to run project on browser.
4. Run command "yarn android" to run project on android.

## Your Requirements.
1. Pixel Perfect Design
2. Animation
3. Show received brocast messages
4. Message Search
5. Message Editing
6. Fake API Invocation

## My Achievements
1. Pixel Perfect Design
    
     	Without using any UI libraries, I turned your figma design into React Native Web Pages.

2. Implement Animations
	
		By using "Animated.View" component, I implemented all animations you listed.
		Animations such as resizing, moving, fadeIn, fadeOut and etc. 
	
3. React Native Navigation
		By using "Stack.Navigator", I created 6 screens and then by using "navigate()" function, I integrated these screens.
		I also communicated between screens by using "route.params" variable.
	
4. Invoke Fake API
	
		By using "axios", I invoked api asynchronously.
	
5. Data Flow using Redux
	
		I loaded "UserInfo" from API and I saved this data in "store".
		Then By using "useSelector", I get the value of "userinfo" such as interested tags, username and etc.
	
6. Using Hook

		By using "useState()" and "useEffect()" function, I store data as state which I get from API.
	
7. Message Search By Keyword and Tag
	
		By using Javascript "filter()" function, I filtered message data by keyword and tag.
	
## Not Implemented
1.  City Selection
2.  Voice Input Search
